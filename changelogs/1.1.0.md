# Update 1.1.0

### Chnagelog
- Removed the 'Yoink nbt button' as it is no longer needed. (Was added for testng purposes only)
- Supported versions as of 1.0.4:
  - Minecraft: `1.21.2, 1.21.3, 1.21.4, 1.21.5, 1.21.6, 1.21.7, 1.21.8`
- Button scales with gui scale
### Code Changes
- Fixed a bug in the `build.gradle.kts` to ensure that `generateBuildConfig` task copies and replaced the `BuildConfig.java` file correctly.
- Updated the `build.gradle.kts` to ensure that the `generateBuildConfig` task is executed before the `compileKotlin` task.
- Removed unused library `mccoroutine`
- Added multiversion support with the help of `stonecutter` and the `zoomify` mod (Most of the gradle code is from that repo)
-
