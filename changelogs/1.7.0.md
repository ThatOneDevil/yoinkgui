# Update 1.6.4 (2025-12-27)

## Features
- Added /yoinkgui debug command where u can copy latest log along with mod info for easier bug reporting
- Added the ability to move the parse buttons around the screen by dragging them. Press M to toggle the menu
- Removed scale from config and made it a scrollable option in the menu (press M to open)

## Fixes

- Ensure the parse button hover state won't accidentally trigger when the inventory (or other screens) are closed.
- Prevent failures when sending formatted chat notifications (wraps chat sends and records errors instead of crashing).

## Code changed
- Added devauth for development stuff idk
