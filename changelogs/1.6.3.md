``# Update 1.6.3 (2025-12-30)

## Features

- Added shadow parsing (e.g., `<shadow:hex:alpha>`) to allow for custom shadow colors in text
- Added the ability to toggle the parsing options for all options on by default
- Added the option to include raw nbt data in the file

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed duplicate text rendering issue where text was being appended twice:
  - The TextHandler was appending text via `ComponentValueRegistry.process(obj)` on line 28
  - The same text was being appended again via `obj.get("text")?.asString` on line 32
  - Removed the redundant append to prevent text duplication

# Code changes
- I see the problem! On line 32, it appends obj.get("text")?.asString again, but the TextHandler already appended the text in line 28 via ComponentValueRegistry.process(obj). This causes the text to appear twice.``
