## How to use?

- When u load the mod with the correct dependencies, all you have to do is open a GUI, click the button on the top left **Yoink and Parse NBT into file** and then head over to your config folder, and there should be a **.txt** file. You can also view the path in the console of the client where it is sent!

- For instance, this is where u can find it on Prism, as this is what I use.
`C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\PrismLauncher\instances\1.21.8\minecraft\config`
